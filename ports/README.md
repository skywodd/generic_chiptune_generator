To compile the main project you need to choose one of this port file (or create your own port file).

Currently three port files are available :
* Computer (windows, and with a little modification linux and mac)
* LPC1768 / LPC1769
* AVR ATtiny85

Choose one, copy it to main project directory, and rename it to port.h
After that you're ready to compile !
